It's been a few days since Malphasar was revived because of the third effect of Baphomet's Demon Domination skill. (Chap- 408)</p><p>Before Malphasar's revival, Baphomet was worried that after his revival Malphasar would lose all his memories and he would not be able to get any information from him about what had happened outside the Shadow Realm that day. But his worries were proven wrong because Malphasar was revived with all his memories intact. The only side effect was that Malphasar lost two of his levels after the revival, but it was a small price to pay to be able to live once again.</p><p>Since he had all of his memories, Malphasar told him everything that had happened that day. From his fight against Valtair to the fact that someone helped him while he was fighting against Valtair. He did not hide anything and told everything.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "cid": "74866471376841214"}
