Evan was already on guard when the elf suddenly appeared in front of him, so the moment the elf slashed at him, he immediately jumped back. </p><p>The moment Evan jumped back, a sharp blade made of water shot out of the elf's hand, barely missing Evan who would have had his head severed if he hadn't jumped back in time. </p><p>'Why the fu*k are all these red-eyed bastards aiming for my head?' Evan cursed inwardly when he realized that similar to the bulky man, the elf was also targeting his head.
