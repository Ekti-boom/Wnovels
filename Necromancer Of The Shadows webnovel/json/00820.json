From time to time, the cave entrance flashed with red, green, purple, and various other lights, as if someone had turned on a disco ball inside it.</p><p>The pressure coming out of the cave was peculiar. It wasn't strong enough to deeply affect rank one and other core evolvers, but for some reason, it covered a wide range of area.</p><p>Even from one hundred thousand kilometres away, people could feel the pressure that the cave was releasing, which is why so many people had found the cave and gathered there.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "cid": "78228916849925438"}
