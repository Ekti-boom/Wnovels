After leaving the arena Leon went towards his room in the academy where he rarely visits. </p><p>Leon is a C+ rank hunter so he rarely stays in the academy and spent most of his time outside doing different kinds of missions, or clearing dungeons to gather resources for himself. </p><p>The rules of the academy will be quite lax on you after you become a C rank hunter. </p><p>Unlike other students who will have to attend classes if they are not doing a mission or have an emergency, you don't need to bother about these things after reaching C rank. </p><p>You will be allowed to skip classes since they also knew there is very little a C rank hunter can gain after going into classes. </p><p>But this thing is only limited to the students who reached the C rank. And it is not easy to reach C rank while you are still attending the academy. </p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "cid": "69184062627052313"}
