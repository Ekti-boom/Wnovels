D+ rank is their racial limit.</p><p>Just like goblins, there are many monsters who are bound by racial limits and can't improve their rank after they reached to a certain rank. </p><p>Evan was thinking about turning rare monsters who are bound by racial limits into shadow undeads. </p><p>These rare monsters can be considered extremely powerful among the monsters of the same rank, but they can't reach a high rank because of their racial limit. </p><p>For example, there is a possibility that a goblin king may be born among the goblins. The Goblin king is also a goblin and it is also bound by racial limit. </p><p>But compared to normal goblins, a goblin king is far more powerful. Besides being more powerful than normal goblin, goblin kings are also very good at alchemy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "cid": "72361580901222646"}
