When he entered the room, he saw that apart from Mogul, there were three more people there.</p><p>The three other people were naturally the leaders of the three other great clans.</p><p>The leader of the Frostfall Alliance was a man who was looking in his mid fifties. He was around 180cm tall and had light brown hair and black eyes. His name was Edward and on a closer look, Evan noticed that his aura was slightly stronger than Mogul. </p><p>The leader of the Moon Spider Nest was a mature looking beautiful woman named Alumi.
