(Part 1)</h1><p>Evan hovered high in the sky using the Shadow Wings and took a deep breath while looking at a two hundred meters tall mountain below him. </p><p>Suddenly, the two black wings on his back disappeared, and he started to fall towards the mountain. While falling down, a deep golden halo covered his body.</p><p>\"Sky Fall!\" He said in a low voice and immediately lost 90 points of world essence. Although he lost 90 points of world essence and felt a little dizzy, his strength stat increased by 45 points. </p><p>After the evolution of Sonic Resonance, his strength stat was permanently increased by ten, reaching the 95-point mark. And now that he used Sky Fall and increased his strength by another 45 points, his current strength stat was at 140 points, comparable to normal beginner-level rank two core evolvers. </p><p>\"Damn, it's fu*king painful...\" Evan gritted his teeth while falling down as he felt his muscles tearing apart due to the burden of Sky Fall. </p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "cid": "78159789888165525"}
