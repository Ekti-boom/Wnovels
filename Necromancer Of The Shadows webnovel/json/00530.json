This monster somewhat resembles a giant lizard with dragon-like scales all over its body. Iguanox monsters can only be found deep within the wilderness and they usually live as a group. In a sense, iguanox monsters are even rarer than goblin kings.</p><p>The power of Iguanox is very high when compared to other monsters of the same rank. A single A rank Iguanox can even face three normal A rank monsters because of its high attack power and monstrous like defence. </p><p>Some people even speculate that Iguanox monsters have a portion of the true dragon bloodline. But no one can confirm whether this is true or not because there is no real dragon in Arora World.</p><p>Evan had never actually seen an iguanox, but he had seen many pictures of them, and judging by Amara's current appearance, he could easily guess that the monster she had fused herself with was definitely an S rank iguanox.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "cid": "74448896402708486"}
