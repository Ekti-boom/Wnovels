The higher he flies, the harder it becomes for him to control his flight, and the consumption of mana also increases greatly. Which is why he was currently flying twenty meters high in the sky. </p><p>Normally people gain the ability to fly after reaching at A rank, but some people who are good at controlling fire or wind can fly much earlier.</p><p>\"That guy is really not normal\" Leon muttered after seeing the ranking. </p><p>He was also keeping an eye on the rankings, and just now Evan's points almost reached to 10K.</p><p>\"But it is also good since I will be the one who will get those points eventually\" Leon smirked and flew towards Evan's direction even more enthusiastically. </p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "cid": "70111905485739270"}
