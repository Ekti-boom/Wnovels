Atop the black sheep, a man with grey-coloured hair was sitting, looking at the palm of his hand, which was glowing with different colours of light. Sometimes his palm flashed with red light, sometimes orange, sometimes green, and many more.</p><p>\"Ummm... I forgot to ask this, but... You will return Prismatic Fire to me once our agreement period is over, right?\" The lazy-looking man with grey hair who was riding the black sheep heard an old man's voice.</p><p>Evan smiled when he heard Octavius's voice but did not say anything. It had been a few hours since he completed the Soul Pact with Octavius and left the cave dimension. </p><p>Once he bound Octavius's soul with himself using the Soul Pact, the dimension where Octavius was trapped started to collapse. Using his control over the dimension, the old man quickly teleported Evan out of there. </p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "cid": "78623588105637743"}
