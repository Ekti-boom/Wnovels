There were occasionally one or two C rank orcs, but he did not get any C rank core after killing them. </p><p>In this one hour, he collected a total of nine cores. Five of these cores were D+ rank while four were D rank. </p><p>Evan absorbed all the D+ rank cores, but he didn't absorb the D rank cores.</p><p>He absorbed one D rank core earlier, but he found his monarch core barely progressed after absorbing it. </p><p>For some reason, he felt his monarch core didn't absorb the energy of the D rank core, and that energy disappeared somewhere. </p><p>It was the same thing that happened when he tried to absorb F rank cores in the past to get skills. </p><p>At that time when he absorbed those F rank cores, he felt their energy also disappeared somewhere and his monarch core did not absorb it. </p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "cid": "70622148422582994"}
