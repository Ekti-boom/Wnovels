Behind them stood more than one thousand shadow undeads who were the members of Team Red. </p><p>\"It will be a disadvantage to us if we fight inside the cave,\" Evan muttered, looking at the entrance of the cave. </p><p>The mid-level Rank Two and two beginner-level monsters who were inside the cave already felt their presence, but they didn't come out and were planning to stay inside. </p><p>Evan did not want to fight inside the cave because it would be impossible for all the members of Team Red to fight in such a narrow space. Moreover, if he ordered his shadow undeads to attack recklessly inside the cave, the treasure that the monsters are protecting might get destroyed by the power of the attacks. </p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "cid": "77811935118154341"}
